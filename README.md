# SearchAlgorithms-NpuzzleGame
Search algorithms for N puzzle game including BFS IDS and A* 
The program reads from a input file a init state of the pazzel and write the solution to output file 
The input file includes:in the first line- the algorithm we want to use IDS=1 BFS=2 A*=3, in the second line- the size of the board (N),
for example 3 (specifies a 3 * 3 puzzle), in the third line - the init state, for exmpale 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-0-8.
The solution includes: the directions that we need to move the tiles of the puzzle,
the cost/depth of the searc and the numbers of nodes that evaluated.
